# Machine_Learning

These are a few of the R projects I have done during my leisure time to gain a good understanding of machine learning and data science.
I have shared the code for these projects to demonstate the work I've done and also help others who are new to this field like me.

Also i have done couple of the same projects in Python. I've published that to my ML-Python repository.
