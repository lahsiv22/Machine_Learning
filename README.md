# Machine_Learning

These are a few of the R projects I have done during my leisure time to gain a good understanding of machine learning and data science.
I have shared the code for these projects to demonstate the work I've done and also help others who are new to this field like me.

I've used concepts such as:

1.K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm

2.Deep Learning

3.Bayes algorithm

4.Linear Regression

One of the projects I've published to this repository is based on Sentiment Analysis on Twitter which imports current data from Twitter's API for analysis. It can analyse the positivity and negativity of the tweets about a specific term or a word.

Also i have done couple of the same projects in Python. I've published that to my ML-Python repository. 

Thank You

Have a great day.
